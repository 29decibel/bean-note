## Personal Note Service

BeanNote is a opensource note application. Now it contains a backend RESTful service which persisting note content into mongodb(will support any storage in the future),
but it really designed for adapting any persisten storage(including Dropbox).

## Why another note app?
Catch is down, a lot of services down recently. I want to have something always be there. And allow people to change the part they
do not like.


## TODO
* supporting SQL storage
* supporting Dropbox sync
* supporting MarkDown format/editor
* offline access
* Chrome plugin to clip any article to bean note
